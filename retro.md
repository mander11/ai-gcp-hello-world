- using a rotation timer helps in reminding to balance the voices; avoiding one person dominating the conversation
- we were focused on the problem itself **more** than on the Ensemble techniques - "problem-solving" mode, and less disciplined about teamwork patterns
- felt not very confident while working (Speaking or Typing)
- intimidated by this new way of working
- cool to see how to set up a gitpod

 - Positevely surprised by how easy this was
 - Using chat was very very helpful
 - chat gives me confidence... not because i trust it all the time... but i get a feeling, for the right directions to take
    it gives me confidence on what direction i should take
    it gives you concrete things to try, and good feedback
 - on thing i like, don't assume...
   just give it the entire output of a thing
        - maybe it will pick up on some thing... that you didn't even think about...
